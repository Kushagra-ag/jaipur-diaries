        Hawa Mahal or the 'Palace Of The Winds' located in the heart of the beautiful Pink City of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India, is one of the most famous tourist attractions and a prominent landmark of the city that is renowned for its rich cultural and architectural history.</p>

        <p>Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of the great Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh constructed the Hawa Mahal in 1799. He was so impressed with the Khetri Mahal built by Maharaja Bhopal Singh in the town of Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan that he embarked on constructing the Hawa Mahal that today stands as a remarkable gem of Rajput style of architecture. Hawa Mahal was also known as the chef-d'úuvre of Maharaja Jai Singh.</p>
        <p>It was built as an extension of the Royal City Palace and leads to the zenana or women's chambers. The Purdah system was strictly followed at that time. Rajput royal ladies were not supposed to be seen by strangers or appear in any public area. The construction of Hawa Mahal allowed the royal ladies to enjoy from every day street scenes to royal processions on the street without being seen.

        <p>
         Its artitechture, designed by Lal Chand Ustad, is a splendid fusion of Islamic, Mughal, and Rajput architectural styles.
       </p>
       <p>
         This five-stories monument was built with red and pink sandstones in the form of Krishna’s crown because Sawai Pratap Singh was devoted to Krishna, the Hindu god. It rises up to a height of 50 feet, but due to the lack of solid foundations, it is curved and leans at an angle of 87 degree. Still the palace stands upright because of the pyramidal shape and is the tallest building in the world without a foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
         Each of the five floors of the Hawa Mahal has a temple in it. The autumn celebrations took place in the Sharad Mandir on the first floor. Ratan Mandir with a colourful glasswork is on the second floor. The top three storeys are a single thick room, namely Vichitra Mandir, Prakash Mandir and Hawa Mandir. The Maharaja worshipped Lord Krishna at the Vichitra Mandir while the Prakash Mandir provided an open terrace to both sides. What is worth noting is that there are no steps to the upper floors but ramps. They are for the palanquin of the royal ladies.
       </p>
       <p>
         The mahal has a total of 953 small casements each with small lattice worked pink window, balconies and arched roofs with hanging cornices. These windows (jharokhas) were built in such a manner that air circulates naturally through them creating Venturi effect (doctor breeze) thus air conditioning the entire structure during the hot summers resembling a honeycomb of a beehive. It was the favorite resort of Maharaja Jai Singh who loved Hawa Mahal for its cooling effect as well as decorated interiors.
       </p>
       <p> Hawa Mahal does not have a direct entrance, you will have to enter from the side of the City Palace. The entry to the Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It opens into a large courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on three sides, with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the east side.</p>
       <p>Its domed canopies, floral patterns, lotus motifs, and fluted pillars, all reflect the rich Rajput style. There are fountains adorning the center of the building’s courtyard. The interiors of the palace consist of pillared chambers and minimally ornamented corridors that reach up to the top floor. There is an archaeological museum located in the courtyard of the Hawa Mahal that displays a fine collection of antiques, weapons, and other items used by the royals. The museum was established in 1983 and will give you a glimpse into the royal past of the region.

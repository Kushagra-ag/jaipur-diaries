          Garh Ganesh Temple is an 18<sup>th</sup> century temple of Lord Ganesha in the city of Jaipur.</p>
        <p>
          In the Garh Ganesh temple, Lord Ganesha is established in the statue of child Ganesha Vigra Purushakriti (without trunk). The temple was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II when he performed the "Ashwamegha Yagya" before the establishment of Jaipur therefore Garh Ganesh Temple predates Jaipur city. He made the shrine and placed the statue of Lord Ganesha. An interesting historical fact is that Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II was the last Hindu king to perform Ashvamedha Yagya.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord Ganesh is famous for his trunk, but Garh Ganesh is a temple where his sculpture is of his childhood (without a trunk). Devotees comes in large numbers every Wednesday for his blessings. The temple is around 300 years old.

         'Garh' means fort in Hindi. Thus, Garh Ganesh literally means Ganesha of the Fort. The temple is built in the form of a small fortress on the top of a hill. The statue was placed in such a way that it keeps its auspicious eyes on the city of Jaipur.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Some interesting facts about the temple:</strong>
         <ul>
           <li>On the contrary to Pink City this temple is coloured yellow.</li>
           <li>The only way to reach the Mandir is by trekking for 500 meters.</li>
           <li>There are 365 stairs to the temple, signifying 365 days of the year.</li>
           <li>This temple was built using 'tantrik rituals'.</li>
           <li>For many years there was no electricity in this temple. It was by the efforts of local leader Late Girdhari Lal Bhargava that the temple was electrified.</li>
           <li>Maharaja of Jaipur used to see the idol of Lord Ganesha using binoculars every morning.</li>
         </ul>
       </p>
       <p>
         Garh Ganesh Temple was built as a small fortification as it was a part of a defense system envisioned by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur.
       </p>
       <p>
         Jaipur City Palace and Garh Ganesh temple falls on the same axis!! It is claimed that Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II could get a glimpse of Garh Ganesh Temple from his palace room. This seems to be more of a legend.
       </p>
       <p>
         Garh Ganesh Temple could serve as a hide-out for a small duration for Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in case of any war or battle. Its strategic location helped the ruler to keep a vigil over the surrounding areas. Garh Ganesh Temple provides an expansive view of the road leading to Delhi.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Aamagarh,</strong> a similar fortification on the eastern hill range in Jaipur covered the road from Agra city. Historians claim that Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II was very intelligent and perceptive. Having fought many wars and battles leading the Mughal army as a general must have led him to build a strong defense system for Jaipur.

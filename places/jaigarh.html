        <p>
          Jaigarh Fort was made with the purpose of protecting Amer Fort and the town below it, as the region around jaipur was intially ruled from Amer. It was built in 1726 AD (between 15th to 18th centuries) by Sawan Jai Singh II. The Jaigarh fort was never conquered in battle. During the Mughal Dynasty, the fort bore witness to an ambush by Aurangzeb who defeated and killed his own brother who was the overseer of the cannon outpost in the fort. Apart from that, the fort never witnessed any major resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>During Meenas-</strong> History also says that Jaigarh Fort is as old as the Amer Fort. The fort was built by Meenas during their rule in Amer. Since they worshipped Goddess Amba so they named the town as Amer or Amber.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>During Kachwahas-</strong> Kachwahas took over the city of Amer from Meenas and ruled during the Mughal period and later. During the rule of Aurangzeb, the fort was given to Raja Sawai Jai Singh II who renovated the fort. Raja Sawai Jai Singh II also built the city of Jaipur which was his dream project.
        </p>
        <p>  
          <strong>During Mughal Period-</strong> The fort was used to keep the weapons which were used in wars. During the rule of Shah Jahan, Dara Shikoh looked after the work in the fort. But when he was killed by his brother Aurangzeb, the fort came under Raja Sawai Jai Singh II who renovated the fort.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the rule of Akbar, Raja Maan Singh accepted to come under Akbarâ€™s rule through a treaty. It was stated in the treaty that the kingdom that Maan Singh wins will come under Mughal rule and the treasure will belong to Maan Singh. He won many places in Afghanistan and others and got a huge treasure which was kept in Jaigarh Fort. Jaigarh Fort is also known as Victory Fort as nobody was able to capture the fort.

         Mostly known as the Fort of Victory, Jaigrah Fort is  located on the Hill of Eagles (cheel ka teela) of Aravali range and covering a large area which is 3 km long and 1 km wide and at a height of 500 feet above sea level. It overlooks the Amer Fort and the Maota Lake and offers panoramic views of the surrounding. The fort is 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) away from the Jaipur city.
       </p>
       <p>
         The royal structure reflects the medieval construction style. Jaigarh Fort is made-up of sandstones and thick walls, designed by a talented architect known as Vidhyadhar. This fort should not be architecturally compared with the palaces of Amer fort as it was establised as a military base of Amer region. Its strength was the main focus and it was strong enough to withstand and attack.
       </p>
       <p>
         The fort has an amazing security wall running on the nearby hills with multiple watchposts. It is situated at a higher elevation than Amer Fort, so that every unwanted activity could be checked from Jaigrah Fort. This fort is full of subterranean and ground level passages. It is connected to the Amer Fort (also called 'Amber' Fort), with subterranean passages, while other passages within the Jaigrah Fort itself are narrow and winding. The best part about the fort is its windows which are made of lattices. These windows allow a complete view of the exteriors, but nothing can be observed from the outside.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Museum and Foundry-</strong> The museum displays puppets, artifacts, photographs and the war utilities of the Rajput rulers. Also this majestic fort has complexes to store the huge weapons, cannons and other arms along with places like warriors assembly. In foundary you can see all the unfinished cannon and cannon balls. The palace where melting of metal was done can also be seen.

       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Laxmi Vilas-</strong> It is a royal drawing room for the kings. It has nice flooring and pleasant wall paintings as this area was meant for important meetings and relaxation.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Lalit Mandir-</strong> A summer place for the kings at Jaigrah Fort. On the ground floor there is a small theatre which was meant to serve royal entertainment.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Vilas Mandir-</strong> It is the zenama or the ladies area with the lattice windows and jharokas, and one of the coolest areas of the palace. Through the windows the entire Amer Fort can be seen.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Aram Mandir/Bagh-</strong> It is a beautiful garden , and a perfect place for rest.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Garden-</strong> Jaigarh Fort has a persian styled square shaped garden which is spread in an area of 50m<sup>2</sup>. The name of the garden is Charbagh as it is divided into four equal parts. Each part of the garden has flower beds containing different species of   flowers. The garden is located in the courtyard of the fort.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Armory-</strong> There is an armory chamber where the tourists can find various weapons like swords, muskets, guns and cannon balls.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Jaivana Cannon-</strong> It houses the world's largest cannon (which was manufactured at cannon foundry at the fort itself) on the wheels called 'Jaivana Cannon'. Jaivana cannon is the largest cannon on wheels developed in 1720. As Rajputs and the Mughals had very   friendly relations, the cannon was never used. The cannon was used only once to test its range (which was found to be 35 kms!).
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>The Water Tank-</strong> There is a huge water tank with rainwater harvesting system which can store a large volume of water but it also has a mystery attached to it. It is rumored that the Kachwaha Dynasty used to store treasure in the chamber below the tank where the  loot from Maharaja Maan Singh was hidden. The rumor was so strong that the former Indian Prime Minister Late Shri Indira Gandhi had given orders to search the fort, which was carried on for three months. However there is no answer to whether the treasure was recovered or not.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>Other Structures-</strong> Ram Harihar Temple and Kal Bhairav Temple are the two temples in the fort. The Ram Harihar temple was built in 10th century while the Kal Bhairav temple was built in 12th century. There are three tanks in the centre of the courtyard that were filled with water for use in the fort.

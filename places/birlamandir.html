        <p>
        Also known as "Lakshmi Narayan Ji Ka Mandir" and located at the base of the Moti Dungari Hill, the temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the preserver and protector of the Universe and his consort Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth. According to some historical sources in 1904, Shree Rang Ramanaujdas, who built this temple, had seen a dream in which Lord Vishnu told him about the location for construction of his temple with his wife, Lakshmi Ji. So this is also a reason for the temple to be called Lakshmi Narayan Mandir.</p>

        <p>The construction of this beautiful place Birla Mandir happened in over a time span of over 8 year starting from 1977 all the way to its completion in 1985 (though its architectural style is still considered to be modern). The consecration ceremony of the temple took place on 22<sup>nd</sup> February 1985, after which the shrine was opened for the public. It was done by Ramanauj Das who was considered a great constructor of that time.</p>

        <p>The land of Birla Mandir was bought by Ghanshyam Birla (It is one of most important investment property of Birla group in Jaipur. They have also made various temples in cities like Delhi, Calcutta, Gujrat, etc.) from Maharaja Man Singh II only for â‚¹1.

           <li>Standing on a raised platform, Birla Mandir is a well-known landmark of Jaipur looking  beautiful from every corner.
           </li>
           <li>The temple is strikingly beautiful after sunset, when it is brightly lit, with the lights illuminating the shrine twinkling in the distance. It is a visual treat to witness at that time.</li>
           <li>The finest quality white marble construction gives a beautiful look to the whole area of that region. The most significant part of the temple is the stunning idol of Lakshmi Narayan, carved out from a single piece of stone. Also as you enter the premises of the temple, you are confronted by the image of Lord Ganesha which is considered to be immensely auspicious.</li>
           <li>Birla Temple of Jaipur is renowned for its fine carvings and delicate work. The walls and pillers are filled with the  traditional art designs. Temple walls are designed with some paintings which are related to Lord Shree Ram, Shree Krishna and some pictures from the history of Hindu Religion. Apart from the religious idols, pictures and figures of several religious saints, philosophers and historical achievers, like Socrates, Buddha, Zarathustra and Confucius, are also included in the temple, indicating the unbiased nature of the shrine.</li>
           <li>The internal roof area is decorated with all kinds of flowers.</li>
           <li>The huge inner hall and a big tomb shaped roof gives an attractive vision to its visitiors.</li>
           <li>Public entry is restricted in the areas of carefully manicured lush green gardens because the temple is one of the most neat and clean and hygienic areas, with beautiful greenary, and different varieties of flowers and plants.</li>
           <li>The museum situated in basement stores historical materials and some essential things which explain about the temple history and some apparent facts related to Birla Family.</li>
           <li>The three huge Domes of the temple are believed to represent the three major religions followed in India. There are four distinct parts of the temple: its sanctum, tower, main hall, and entrance.</li>

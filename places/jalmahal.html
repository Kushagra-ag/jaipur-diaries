        Jal Mahal, one of the top places to visit in Jaipur, doesnâ€™t have any recorded history about who built it or when. Some people credit Maharaja Madho Singh I for the construction of this palace and date its origins back to the 1750s, which makes it approximately 270 year old palace, built in 1750. Later, the palace was renovated by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amber in the 18th century which  greatly enhanced the interior of the palace adding the courtyard grounds and much of the exterior as seen today. Jal Mahal was believed to be built during famines, when the lake bed had completely dried up. So, the whole edifice was visible when it was built.</p>

         This spectacular structure that seems to be floating in the middle of the picturesque of the Man Sagar Lake (surface area = 300 acres and maximum depth = 4.5 meters), is one of the most beautiful monuments and major tourist attractions of India. If one side of the lake  provides a pleasing glimpse of the Man Sagar Lake and the Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") Hills, which is spread around it, the other side is the bustling city of Jaipur.
       </p>
       <p>
         The low-rise symmetrical structure, built in red sandstone is a splendid combination of the Rajput and Mughal styles of architecture. When the lake is full of water,this five storied structure has the first 4 stories under water! and only the one top floor is visible above water( giving you an impression that the palace is actually floating on the waters of the lake) but still the palace's solid stone walls were built thick enough to hold back millions of litres of water so that no water seeps in through any pore and the special designed lime mortar has prevented water seepage for over 250 years. 
       </p>
       <p>
         Four elaborate chhatris designed in octagonal shape adorn the four corners of the palace. A huge Bengal-style rectangular chhatri also exists on the roof of the palace. Since the palace was never meant to be used as a regular palace for living (and was built as a picnic spot rather than a residential structure, for the sake of royal family) there are no personal chambers in it. Though this magistic scene of deep blue color of the waters of the lake contrasting with the sand coloured stone walls of the Jal Mahal makes it the most photographed place but unfortunately exploration of the actual palace is off limits to the majority of visitors due to some security reasons.

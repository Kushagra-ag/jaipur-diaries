          The Indian state of Rajasthan is known for its beauty and royal heritage. Formed by the union of many princely states ruled mainly by Rajputs, Rajasthan has many ancient forts and palaces. Many of these palaces and forts are linked with important historical events as well. Nahargarh Fort, along with the other two forts, Jaigarh Fort and Amer Fort, once formed a strong defense for Jaipur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nahargarh is located in one of the oldest mountain ranges of the world, the Aravalli Hills. This fort gives you a breathtaking view of the scenic surroundings and the Jaipur city. One of the major tourist attractions of Jaipur, Nahargarh Fort is noted for its huge and extended wall which connects it to the Jaigarh Fort.

        <p>
    	 Rajasthan’s history is filled with regal legends and royal stories. According to historians, the Nahargarh Fort was constructed as a retreat palace in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. Initially the fort was named Sudarshangarh Fort which was later changed to Nahargarh Fort which indicates 'The Adobe of Tigers'. According to the history of Nahargarh Fort, it was built for the protection of the city, but fortunately, the fort never came under any attack during that period.
       </p>
       <p>
         According to the historians, Nahargarh fort was named after a Rajput Prince Nahar Singh Bhomia. He was a Rathore prince and the land, on which the Fort was built, belonged to him. According to the stories, his spirit created obstacles in the building of the fort and haunted the area. To pacify his spirit Maharaja Jai Singh built a fortress inside the fort on the order of the spirit. 
       </p>
       <p>
         The fort was extended in 1868, during the reign of Sawai Ram Singh. In 1883-92, a range of palaces was built at Nahargarh by Dirgh Patel at a cost of nearly three and a half lakh rupees. The Madhavendra Bhawan, built by Sawai Madho Singh had suites for the queens of Jaipur and at the head was a suite for the king himself. The rooms are linked by corridors and still have some delicate frescoes. Nahargarh was also a hunting residence of the Maharajas. Until April 1944, the Jaipur State government used solar time read from the Samrat Yantra in the Jantar Mantar Observatory for its official purposes, with a gun fired from Nahargarh Fort as the time signal.
       </p>
       <p>
       	Some scenes in the movies Rang De Basanti, Shuddh Desi Romance, and Sonar Kella were shot at Nahargarh Fort.
       </p>
       <p>
       	Jaipur wax museum is yet another attraction built on the left side at the entrance of Nahargarh fort with support from the Department of Archaeology & Museums Jaipur, Department of Tourism and Government of Rajasthan. The place earlier known as Vishram Ghar-Rest House for the soldiers and Shastragar-Artillery, Jaipur wax museum is a brainchild of Mr. Anoop Srivastava, the founder Director, and was inaugurated on December 17, 2016 by Bollywood star Govinda. The wax museum has more than 35 wax and silicon statues from the field of sports, bollywood, social activists, freedom fighters, Sawai Ram Singh, Maharaja Jai Singh, Madho Singhi, and Rajmata Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur along with first look-alike robotic tiger. A replica of Kohinoor Diamond is a recent attraction. The one of its own kind, Sheesh Mahal, the palace of mirrors, a new landmark of Jaipur built in the adjoining building with 25 million glass pieces with thikri, mirror work and gold polish give a magnificent royal look and feel.

        <p>
         This fort is an excellent example of Indo-European architecture. The bright yellow-colored fort is made of stone masonry and lime. Large courtyards, towers, and grand gates are the influence of Rajput's architecture. Madhavendra Bhawan, the main palace compound was built by Madho Singh Ji. It is the focal point of the fort.
       </p>
       <p>
         It comprises of 9 double-storeyed suites for 9 different queens. These suites are identical and are connected by corridors. The suites are beautifully decorated with Rajput Mughal frescoes depicting lifestyle, flowers, etc.
       </p>

         These frescoes contrast with colored glass windows. Palace windows open to Jaipur city which reminds of the royal life of the ladies. The 10th suite was meant for the king himself. Notably, each suite has its kitchen and toilet. To summarize, here is a list of 9 suites named after the queens:
       </p>

         <ul>
         	<li>Suraj Prakash Mahal</li>
         	<li>Chandra Prakash Mahal</li>
         	<li>Anand Prakash Mahal</li>

       </p>
       	<h3 style="font-weight: 600;">Water Reservoirs or Baodis of Nahargarh</h3>
       	<p>
       	As most Rajput Hill forts in Rajasthan, Naharhgarh also has its own water conservation system. There are 2 baodis or step wells inside the fort. One is in the front of the palace and other is opposite to Madhavendra Bhawan. These are built using the cut in the natural rifts. They both are connected to many canals in the area in order to collect rain water. The water stored in these was enough for a year’s need. Interestingly, a bollywood movie 'Rang De Basanti' was shot at this site.

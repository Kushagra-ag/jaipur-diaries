        Gatore Ki Chhatriyan is a fascinating hidden gem. <i>'Gatore'</i> literally means <i>'Gaye ka thor'</i> which in Hindi translates to 'resting place of the deceased'. Thus, as the name suggests it was a royal crematorium ground meant for the majestic rulers of the Kachhwaha community of Rajasthan, a Rajput clan, that ruled the land centuries ago. The cenotaphs are shaped like umbrellas <i>(chhatris)</i> and hence the place is called Gatore Ki Chhatriyan. The place was chosen by <b>Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II</b>, the founder of Jaipur, in the 18th century for cremating the members of the royal family. It is located in the foothills of Nahargarh Fort enclosed by the green Aravalli Hills.</p>

         They’re beautiful pieces of architecture to behold. The monument is built in Rajput architectural style. But Mughal influence is also clearly noticeable.
       </p>
       <p>
         Gatore ki Chhatriyan is a cluster of temples and tombs. Engraved with beautiful Rajasthani carvings, the cenotaphs of the royals are omnipresent all around the complex, creating what looks like a mix of shrunken open-air palaces and ornate towers. The structures mark the spots where the former ruling kings were cremated. Every Structure has a chhatri (ornated umbrella), which is a common fixture in Indian memorials or cremation sites. The most impressive structures are made of marble while others were constructed with sandstone. Some are embellished with intricate carvings of elephants, battle scenes, nature, divinity and so on. The site is divided into three parts. Stone art work, round stairs and depictions on the pillars commemorate the life and lifestyles of historical times. 
       </p>
       <p>
         <mark>The most grandiose memorial is dedicated to Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. His memorial structure is made of white marble and is decorated with carvings of Hindu Gods, maids, musicians and other people. It truly justifies the era of greatest ruler of Jaipur. The dome is placed on 20 pillars. A copy of Jai Singh’s cenotaph is also showcased at Kensington Museum in London.</mark>
       </p>
       <p>
         A long strong Fort wall connects Nahargarh Fort and Gatore site. It is said that the safe passage was used by the royal family of Jaipur to reach Gatore from <i>Nahargarh fort.</i>
       </p>
       <p>
         Overall, the location and the architecture make it a serene and beautiful spot filled with a sort of contemplative quietness not afforded to the city's more popular attractions and where anyone with a meditative bent of mind can sit back, relax, and ponder over the mysteries of life for hours.<br> <mark>Book lovers can find great delight in reading at this location.</mark>

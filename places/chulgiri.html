        In the year 1953 the Jain Hierophant Shri Desh Bhushan Maharaj came to this place and found it very scrumptious and peaceful with mortification point of view, so he chose this place for his mortification and later on he decided to build a Jain shrine over here and hence, the name Chulgiri was given by Shri Desh Bhushan Maharaj to this place.</p>

          Initially there were three splendid sculptures, as was propounded in 1966, which are made of white stone. These three statutes are of the three most popular Tirthankars (Shree Parshavnath, Mahaveer Swami and Neminath). The Parshavnath statue is 7 feet high and the Mahaveer Swami sculpture is approx 3.5 feet. Later on, 24 Tirthankar’s statues were also installed and a small water tank was also made to collect rain water for worship and consecration of god.

The main temple of this Kshetra was constructed in the 12th century. The nearby 10 temples were constructed in the 15th century by the percept of Bhattarak Ratnakirti. According to one inscription found here the main temple was constructed in Samvat 1223. But no inscriptions are available regarding the construction of 84 feet high idol. The scholar of the 13th century Yati Madan Kirti had mentioned about this idol and also told that 'Arkakirti' was the builder of this idol.

         The huge magnificent tallest idol of India established in Chulgiri Siddha Kshetra is made by cutting rock of one single mountain only. This 84 feet high Khadgasan idol of Bhagwan Adinath is made in brown stone. As no written evidence is available regarding its construction it is very difficult to say anything about its construction period. The idol of Bhagwan Adinath (Rishabhdev) stands on base of mountain just like the idol of 'Gomteshwar Bahubali' of Shravanbelgola. The hands of idol are not joined with legs but are made separate. The structural art and style of this idol is unique and it is in perfect proportion. The various parts of idol are quite symmetrical. There is balanced image of all emotions like joy, mercy and separation on the face of this idol. On the left side there is a huge idol of Bawangaja Bhagwan Adinath, the 4 armed 'Gomukh Yaksha', and on the right side a very artistic idol of 16 armed 'Yakshi Chakreshvary' is established. Because of the large size of the idol one can not got complete view of idol by standing on feet of this idol. Therefore in order to get complete view one has to stand a little distance away from the idol. The idol of Bhagwan Ajitnath carved artistically on a stone slab present here is also quite worth seeing.

         The Chulgiri temple is also situated on the Hilltop and this temple is also called as Siddha Bhoomi. Indrajeet, Kumbhakaran and various other scholars attained emancipation through self-meditation. This is an ancient and spired temple whose construction and restoration according to inscription was done in Samvat 1116, 1223 and 1508. The 3 ancient foot images of Indrajeet, Kumbhakaran and the other are present in this temple. Except foot images the 2 idols of Bhagwan Mallinath and Chandraprabhu are also installed in the main alter. Moreover several idols are installed on both sides in the main assembly hall (Mahamandap).

         A fine landscape is like a piece of music, beautiful and blissful. And the Sanctum Place of Jainese Chulgiri, a heavenly place is encompassed by Aravalli ranges is one such scenic landscape. About 18 kilometers from Jaipur, Chulgiri, a famous Jain Digambara Temple is perched on top of the North end of the Jhalana Range. Though it has a motorable road but a walk up the stairs is also pretty exciting. The climb up to the temple can be tiring but the views of the surrounding forests from the top can be worth the effort. Especially in rains when the trees turn completely green the views are breathtaking.

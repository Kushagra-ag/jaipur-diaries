          Jaipur a city built in A.D. 1727 emerged as city of heritage for its magnificent monuments and for its timeless architecture. Isarlat is also known as the skyscraper of Jaipur. Everyone in Jaipur has seen this structure. Only some of them know it by its name. And hardly anyone knows what is it all about. That's the modern story of a historic building standing in Tripolia Bazaar, one of the busiest roads of Jaipur.

          Isarlat or Sargasuli Tower is a seven-storied historical heritage monument built by Sawai Ishwari Singh in the year 1749. Also known as 'Tower of Heaven', the minaret is inspired by Qutub Minar in Delhi and Kirti Stambh of Chittorgarh. It’s a symbol of great historical importance as its a symbol of Jaipur’s victory. The Sargasuli Tower was once the tallest historical buildings in Jaipur. It still serves you a wonderful opportunity to get a 360-degree view of the cityscape from its roof after you reach the top of this tower.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Sawai Ishwari Singh was the eldest son of the founder of Jaipur, Sawai Jai Singh II. Sawai Jai Singh II was married to Maharani Chandra Kanwar Ji and Sisodia princess of Mewar. Maharani Chandra Kanwar kept a condition for allowing Sawai Jai Singh II to marry the Mewar princess Sisodia. The condition was that the son of Maharani Chandra Kanwar will be the king no matter if he has another son. Sawai Jai Singh II wanted Ishwari Singh to be the king, which which was unacceptable by Maharana of Mewar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crown became a reason of conflict that led to war between both the siblings Sawai Ishwari Singh and Sawai Madho Singh. Sawai Madho Singh was the son of Maharaja Jai Singh II from Maharani Chandra Kanwar Ji. The first war was fought in 1744. Sawai Ishwari Singh was approved as the crowned King with support from the Mughals and was able to defeat Sawai Madho Singh. They attacked him again, got defeated and Sawai Ishwari Singh won the battle with great valor. After this, the memorial was constructed to commemorate the achievement. This sky-high building also served as a watchtower for the palace to guard the residence of the royal family, the City Palace.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to local guides, Ishwari Singh built the Isarlat to check on his minister which he doubted would conspire against him. It is also said that Sawai Ishwari Singh was ostracized for his love for a common girl. Ironically, even after denying his throne being usurped, he is the only Kachhwaha Maharaja who has not been commemorated at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><a href="gatorekichhatriyan.html">Royal Gatore</a></em></span>, the royal crematorium where all monarchs are cremated.

         This sky-piercing victory tower has been constructed by following the rules of Vastu Shastra. Its an architectural delight designed by Ganesh Khowan. The 140 feet high tower is octagonal in shape and yellow in color. The minaret contrasts with the pink buildings and markets of the city. It has an entry from a tiny door that opens up in a beautiful round gallery with a spiraling flight of 264 steps upwards. Every segment has a balcony outlet and interlaced windows that provide visitors with a breathtaking panoramic view of Jaipur City. The circular staircase of the tower is composed in superb cross-section work which ensures air and light to the whole structure. Do not miss this great opportunity to have a beautiful bird's-eye view look at the pink city atop this once called tallest minaret.
       </p>
       <p>
         The architecture of this building built in seven segments is a combination of Rajputs and Mughal-Vastu-genres. In Mughal style, this architecture, similar to those of the four corners of the mosques, has a circular umbrella on the head. The tower is yellow colored. For many decades, the entry of public was forbidden in tower but now it has been opened for the common audience and tourists, because from there you can see a breath-taking 360 degrees panoramic view of entire Jaipur from the roof top.

          Talkatora is an artificial lake situated to the north of Badal Mahal. The lake used to be home to a magnificent garden that was known as <b>‘Paal ka Bagh’</b>.<br/>
          The renowned <b>Badal Mahal</b> and a couple of platforms at both ends, one <i>‘chhatri’</i> in the centre and two flat-roofed <i>‘chhatris’</i> enclosed by a web of meshed windows, the lake was a point of attraction in the celebration of various holidays.

        <p><em>
          At the time when our little Pink City was young and in the process of setting foot in the whole new world out there, there existed a big lake in place known by the name of Talkatora and the pond of Rajamal, where the kings of Amber used to go for hunting.<br/>
        It was the kings that gave it the shape that we see today.</em>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        It is noteworthy to mention that this lake was once home to ferrocious alligators. The royalty at that time made sure that these were adequately fed. They even organized festivals that comprised of activities such as feeding the alligators!
        This history has quite an impact on the reputation of the lake, and as a tribute, the lake is often referred to as the <big><b>'Alligator Tank'</b></big>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The lake was built as a symbol of greenery and attraction. Such was the beauty of the lake that it quickly became one of the iconic places of young Jaipur.
        But alas, the charm didn't last for long and the rapid urbanisation in Jaipur tightened it's reins and sadly, one of the worst hit places was the Talkatora Lake. The lake was then used as a dump yard for the sewage that was collected from the nearby areas.<br/>
        The degradation of the lake was quite catastrophic.<br/>
        <mark> Its color became darker than coal, the surrounding odor was foul, and the mosquitoes found a new home in the place. The collector canals that were the lifeline of water supply for the lake were blocked by the urban development.</mark>

        <span class="lead" style="font-weight: 600"> But,</span> The Jaipur Municipality along with a few volunteers completely changed this picture a few years ago. What used to be the dumping ground, was once again back with its full glory. As of today, the lake is one of the popular tourist spots of Jaipur surrounded by gardens and colorful fountains.
